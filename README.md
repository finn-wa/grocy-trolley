TODO

- create parent during import
- no need to parse price?
- remove or use quantities from receipts
- cart doesn't like saletype: BOTH
- handle cached cookie expiry
- make sure purchase price updates if product already imported
- scheduled backups
- grocy API types are wrong, everything is always a string
- generic products choice should show a current price
- foodstuffsRestService global request throttle?
